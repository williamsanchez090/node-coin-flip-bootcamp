### Goal: Create a simple web application that uses the fs and http modules. Use http to create the server and fs to read your html file. Include vanilla ES6 js in a script tag at the bottom of your html file. Try creating a coin flip guessing game

### Optimization: I would have made my images appear serverside.

### Lesson learned: USE EXPRESS!
